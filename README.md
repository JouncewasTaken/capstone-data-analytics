Using Gradient Boosted Decision Trees to estimate 30 day hospital readmissions using Social Determinants of Health

How to run
load 30DRadmit.ipynb in google colab (or copy from here https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XVYhqUvSbBiSOtGDFlssSFBAopQKZ954?usp=sharing), mount google drive to environment and unzip Sources.zip in /content/drive/MyDrive. Running fully will generate /content/drive/MyDrive/exports which contains all the csv's connected to the Power BI report. The report is linked directly to csv's, not to cloud storage files.
